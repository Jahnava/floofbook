                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>I'm a huge fan of all things sweater-related and perhaps spend way too much time letting my hooman dress me up. I like most of the clothes that my hooman has for me, but sweaters are by far my favorite. My hooman is really niceand gives me treats if I keep my bow in my hair. Usually, I'll allow a maximum of eight pettings before I roll around to get that pesky bow out of my hair. My sweaters are all cozy, so I don't bother rolling out of those. My favorite sweater is red and reminds me of one of my favorite birds, The Northern cardinal.</p>
                <p>I'm a lover of music and enjoy howling along with my hooman to her favorite songs! My favorite howling-songs  are all about dogs, since I can relate with them the most. 
                <br>
                Some of my favorite songs for howling include:
